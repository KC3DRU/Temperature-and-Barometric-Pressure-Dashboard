# Temperature-and-Barometric-Pressure-Dashboard
This project uses a pair of ESP32 boards with LoRa radios and an Adafruit  sensor board to monitor the current temperature and barometric pressure.  The data is published to a Node-RED workflow to create a dashboard of the values and issues alerts for sudden changes.
